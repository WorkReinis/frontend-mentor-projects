# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

Each folder is a separate project built with HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. I use these projects to practice responsive layouts and front-end development best practices.
