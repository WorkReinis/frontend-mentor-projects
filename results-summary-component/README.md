## ðŸŽ¯ Results Summary Component

This is a solution to a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) on Frontend Mentor.  
A project focused on building a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.


## ðŸ§© The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## ðŸ›  My Process

Actually on my first attempt, I **failed** to make a responsive design, as I was too focused on styling each individual element. Starting back from scratch I restructured the HTML layout using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and revisited the styling to make it nice **and** responsive. 

This challenge tested both my patience and attention to detail â€” but Iâ€™m proud of how the final result turned out.


## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to structure clean, maintainable layouts using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system  
- The power of media queries in fine-tuning responsiveness  
- Better use of `flexbox`, custom properties, and efficient selectors
