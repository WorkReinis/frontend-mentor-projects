# Results Summary Component with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

This project is a solution to the [Results Summary Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). A project focused on building a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

> The challenge, while simple at a glance, grew into more than 200 lines of CSS code just to make it what it is.

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Actually on my first attempt, I **failed** to make a responsive design, as I was too focused on styling each individual element. Starting back from scratch I restructured the HTML layout using Bootstrap’s grid system and revisited the styling to make it nice **and** responsive. Overall this challenge required a highly detail-oriented approach to replicate the original as closely as possible and frankly **I think I did good**.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and responsive design

## What I learned
Working on this project helped me build up experience with Bootstrap’s grid layout and CSS media queries. I also strengthened my understanding of flexbox and various CSS selectors. Most importantly, I learned how to design a layout that adapts smoothly across multiple screen sizes.
