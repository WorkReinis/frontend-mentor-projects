## 🧩 The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## 🛠 My Process

Actually on my first attempt, I **failed** to make a responsive design, as I was too focused on styling each individual element. Starting back from scratch I restructured the HTML layout using Bootstrap’s grid system and revisited the styling to make it nice **and** responsive. 

This challenge tested both my patience and attention to detail — but I’m proud of how the final result turned out.


## 💡 What I Learned

- How to structure clean, maintainable layouts using Bootstrap’s grid system  
- The power of media queries in fine-tuning responsiveness  
- Better use of `flexbox`, custom properties, and efficient selectors
